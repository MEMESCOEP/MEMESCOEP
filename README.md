## Heya, I'm Andrew ðŸ‘‹
I like to make games, operating systems and electronic devices. I'm currently learning C++ and Embedded Linux systems with [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/) & [The Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/).
I can be reached via the email listed on my github profile, or by my [Discord profile](https://discordapp.com/users/702231283874660412).

### Current projects:
 * [Chiron](https://github.com/MEMESCOEP/Chiron): a live Linux distro for system rescue, diagnostics, and stress testing.
 * [Saturn](https://github.com/MEMESCOEP/Saturn): a cross-platform 2D game engine designed to be easy to use.
